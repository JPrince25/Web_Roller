            <p class="content">The Bob Ross: Art of of Chill Game is a delightful little game to be played with a few family members or friends. 
                Each participant competes against the others by combining their paints and art supoplies cards to create iconic 
                features before Bob finishes the piece himself, of course he is just a little figurine. Before each player's turn, they must roll
                a unique six-sided die. <b>Three of its faces contain Bob's face, one conatins a hand, one contains a palette, and one 
                contains a card.</b>  If Bob is rolled, you must then reveal one of the Chill Cards from its special deck and complete
                any effects before moving Bob one step closer to finishing the piece. If the hand is rolled, you get to take an additional
                free action of your choice for your turn. If the palette is rolled, you may freely place one paint card to your palette before 
                starting your turn. If the card is rolled, you may take one Art Supplies card from the top of its deck before your turn. For more information
